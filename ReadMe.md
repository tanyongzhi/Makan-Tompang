| A community app that saves our energy in ordering take-out.

**Makan: To eat**
**Tompang: To hitch a ride**

Ever asked your roommate to buy you dinner on their way home? What if you could ask anyone in the community? Makan Tompang is an app that connects users who want a food delivery (buyers) with users who are already at restaurants (couriers). The app considers the route that the courier would take from the restaurant to their homes/destinations, and suggests buyers whose locations are on their route, in order of how much of a detour they would have to make to get to those buyers.
